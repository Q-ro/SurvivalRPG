## Synopsis

A “Survival” RPG game powered by unity and C# scripting, this started as a very simple attempt to get into programming a “commercial” game using the “turn base tutorial” game assets provided by unity. Although still incomplete, the game will feature turn base combat, randomly generated floors, a fully fledge story (already planned, but not implemented), towns and NPCs, limited resources, player status and ailment, toughs decisions, and so on.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a game on the style of my favourite games while trying to bring something new to the gameplay, although play testing will be required to balance some of the elements once game is somewhat done, i think the concept is on the very least interesting.

## Installation

You can download the whole project as a zip, unzip it, and open it with unity, if you want to see the game in action, the "Build" folder contains a Standalone folder, one for each system, download the folder of your system, and double click the file to play (once the game is completed you will be able to grab it from steam’s shop, steam features will be added to the game).

## Disclaimer

The game is still on development, everything but the main character art is not final (and he still can be changed change), story is still not implemented, for now the main focus of the game is implementation of the game mechanics.

## Special thanks

Special thanks to Unity for the awesome tutorial that allowed me to get the project started and seven for inspiration for the project’s direction.
