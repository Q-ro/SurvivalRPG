## Synopsis

A simple solar system simulation powered by unity and C# scripting, this started as a very simple homework excersice developed for week one of Corsera's MOOC titled ["Introduction to Game Development"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development/home/welcome), but i ended up adding more and more stuff to make it more interesting.

## Motivation

I just wanted to apply the concepts learned through the course to make the first "game" we developed a more pleasing experience, and i think the final result is indeed quite pleasing.

## Installation

You can download the whole project as a zip, unzip it, and open it with unity, if you want to see the game in action, the "Build" folder contains a WebBuild, download the folder, and double click the html file, the browser will load the page and then load the game using unity web player (bear in mind, i't will not work with chrome).

## Disclaimer

I tried to make it a very accurate reprensentation of the solar system, but there are still some missing elements that i may add in the future, such Saturn's rings, or the asteroid belt that separated the inner and outter planets.

## Special thanks
